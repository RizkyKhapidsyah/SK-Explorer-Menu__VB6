If you've ever wanted to display the Explorer right-click context menu in 
your VB app then this is the code for you. You make one dll call and pass
it the full path to a file and the context menu for that file type will be 
displayed. 

I've included the DLL and the VC++ source files along with a VB6 project 
showing how to call it. You can distribute the dll anyway you want or 
recompile anyway you want. 

Enjoy,
